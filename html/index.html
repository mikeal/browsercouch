    <h1>BrowserCouch Documentation</h1>
    <p>BrowserCouch is an attempt at an
    in-browser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a>
    implementation. It's written entirely in JavaScript and intended
    to work on all browsers, gracefully upgrading when support for
    better efficiency or feature set is detected.</p>
    <p>Not coincidentally, this library is intended to mimic the
    functionality
    of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB">CouchDB</a> on
    the client-side, and may even support integration with CouchDB in
    the future.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>This prototype is intended as a response to Vladimir
    Vukićević's blog post
    entitled <a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/2009/04/06/html5-web-storage-and-sql/">HTML5
    Web Storage and SQL</a>. A CouchDB-like API seems like a nice
    solution to persistent storage on the Web because so many of its
    semantics are delegated out to the JavaScript language, which
    makes it potentially easy to standardize.  Furthermore, the
    MapReduce paradigm also naturally takes advantage of multiple
    processor cores&mdash;something that is increasingly common in
    today's computing devices.</p>

    <h2>Things to do</h2>

    <p>To learn how to use BrowserCouch, check out the
    work-in-progress <a class="intra-wiki"
    href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, you can run the <a class="intra-wiki"
    href="tests.html">test suite</a> and the <a class="intra-wiki"
    href="big.html">semi-large data set test</a>, though they're not
    particularly exciting. In the future, we'd like to make CouchDB's
    <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/screenshots.html">Futon</a>
    client work entirely using BrowserCouch as its backend instead of
    a CouchDB server, but that's a ways away.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to see more code samples of what the BrowserCouch
    API currently looks like, check out the <a class="intra-wiki"
    href="#js/tests.js">annotated source code for the test suite</a>.
    You can also read the <a class="intra-wiki"
    href="#../js/browser-couch.js">primary source code documentation</a>
    for more on BrowserCouch's implementation.</p>
